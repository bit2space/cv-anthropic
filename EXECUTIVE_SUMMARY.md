## 💡 INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### What Makes This Application Different:

**Traditional Approach:**
```
1. Submit CV on website
2. Wait for response
3. Hope for the best
```

**Your Approach:**
```
1. Create impressive landing page (with Claude!)
2. Use it to reach out directly to Anthropic team
3. Show, don't just tell
4. Bring a market opportunity, not just skills
5. Make it impossible to ignore
```

### Why This Could Work:

1. **Anthropic is expanding globally** - your timing is perfect
2. **Eastern Europe is underserved** - you're bringing opportunity
3. **You're a Claude power user** - cultural fit, product understanding
4. **Proven track record** - not just ideas, actual results
5. **Memorable approach** - landing page built with Claude is meta and smart

### Potential Objections (And How to Address):

**Objection:** "We're not hiring for this role yet"
**Response:** "I'm not applying for a job. I'm proposing we explore the Eastern Europe opportunity together. Let's have a conversation."

**Objection:** "We work with agencies for international expansion"
**Response:** "Agencies don't have 15 years of hands-on experience launching products in these specific markets. I've done it repeatedly and successfully."

**Objection:** "Your background is more PM than expansion lead"
**Response:** "My PM experience IS expansion experience. Every product I've managed involved international launches. Building Companion alone was 8 countries."

**Objection:** "We're focused on other markets first"
**Response:** "Perfect. While you're focused there, let's prepare the Eastern Europe strategy so when you're ready, we can execute immediately."
