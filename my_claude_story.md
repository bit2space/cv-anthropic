# The Claude Effect: My Story

## The Discovery

I found Claude while drowning in documentation. Running Royal Company means juggling development services for Xella, coordinating with engineering teams across Poland and Romania, and somehow keeping the BCS marketplace moving forward. I needed help that understood context, not just keywords.

## The Transformation

Claude changed everything about how I work.

First, it was PRDs. Writing product requirements for the unit conversion system—explaining why Polish contractors need prices in m³ while Romanian ones think in pallets—used to take days. Now I think out loud with Claude, and coherent documentation emerges. The BCS unit conversion PRD that took me a week before? Done in an afternoon.

Then came the automation obsession. I started building MCP servers, connecting Claude to my actual workflows. Invoice processing with multilingual detection. LinkedIn content automation. n8n workflows that actually work. Each project taught me something new about what's possible when AI understands your context.

The PowerPoint presentations for PKB (Polish Construction Cluster) were a revelation. Instead of staring at blank slides, I described what I needed, and Claude helped me structure arguments that resonated with construction industry stakeholders. Not generic business-speak—actual industry-specific messaging.

But the real shift was in technical coordination. Managing Jira epics, talking to Radu and the engineering team, translating business requirements into specs developers actually want to read. Claude became my thinking partner for bridging that gap.

## The Realization

After months of this, something clicked: if Claude transforms how I work in Poland—managing B2B marketplaces, coordinating international teams, building automation—imagine what it could do for millions of professionals across Eastern Europe who face the same challenges.

Most AI tools don't understand our markets. The regulatory complexity. The business culture differences between Warsaw and Bucharest. The specific workflows that matter here.

I do. And I've been using Claude to prove it works.

## The Meta-Moment

This entire landing page? Built with Claude. The strategy documents, the case studies, even this story was refined through conversation.

That's not a confession—it's the point. Claude is already good enough to help me create something I'm proud to share. Now imagine what happens when someone who understands Eastern European markets helps shape Claude's future there.
